<p><em>One month ago I was back home in Wisconsin, visiting family, when I got the call congratulating me on being accepted into Microsoft LEAP’s TPM track. As I’m writing this, it’s the weekend in between completing the 3 week classroom-based prep portion of the program and starting my first day on my sponsoring team.</em></p>

<h2> The First Days </h2>

<p>The first couple of days were introductions and getting setup. That’s basically it.</p>

<p>
That entailed getting our badges, laptops, a swag bag chock full of goodies, and trying to find room in the cafeteria for all of us to sit. We were very aspirational with that last one.
</p>

<p>
In general, these days didn’t have much content-wise, but it was very reflective of a typical first day starting with any program or job of this sort. Everyone comes in full of energy, only to spend it mostly on waiting to get permission to get started doing anything.
