<p><em> You're hired! Yay! Welcome to the Meowspace team where you'll be building what the internet has been missing most, a cat social network. Lick those paws and lets get to work building this app with using Ember and Rails! </em></p><br>

<h2> What is Meowspace? </h2>

<p>  </p>

<h2> Who is going to be using Meowspace? </h2>

<p> </p>

<h2> Cool, so, uh, how are we doing this? </h2>

<p> This tutorail is going to be split into three parts: </p>
  <ul> 
    <li> Backend with Rails </li>
    <li> Frontend with Ember </li>
    <li> and Design </li>
  </ul>
<p> Each of those parts will be split into multiple, easy to digest tutorials.  </p>

<h2> Lez get started!  </h2>

<p> Awesome Enthusiasm! I really like it, but, uh, give me another week until I give you the rest... </p>
