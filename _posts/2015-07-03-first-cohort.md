<p><em>I taught my very first class this past June in front of 13 teenagers who, much like myself, had no idea what they were getting themselves into.  </em></p>
<br>


<h2> Learn. Love. Code. </h2>

<p> In the matter of two weeks I was meant to turn these kids from knowing nil about programing into making a live, deployed sinatra app for all the interwebs to see.</p> <p> Having never formally taught teenagers, I was nervous on how quickly they'd pick up the material or if they'd even be interested in any of it. With the help of a fantastic co-teacher, we quickly built a class that was not only excited to come to class, but also code!   </p>

<h2> Not your average classroom </h2>

<p> Sure, kids were spending full days inside a room learning things. You'd think it'd be a lot like school, but it wasn't. And we made sure of it.  </p>

<p> Classroom culture was key and easily one of the most imporant parts of our classes. We made sure to have plenty of breaks, do improv and have a classroom that wouldn't be afraid of being silly in front of each other. </p>

<h2> Final Projects </h2>

<p> The first round of final projects set the bar high! Before starting I thought it was crazy making kids build an app in only a couple days. But they constantly suprised me and put these projects together like they'd been coding for years. </p>
