<p><em> For six precious summer days, I camped on Mt Baker for a mountaineering course that ended with a very successful summit. After living in Washington state for 2 years and doing the more strenuous day hikes, this summer seemed like the perfect time to start learning more technical skills in order to do more difficult approaches. </em></p>

<h2> Mountains Are Calling </h2>

When I first moved to Seattle, I had no idea the city was surrounded by some of the best mountains and mountain ranges. I was first surprised with my first night in my new apartment in downtown, where I stood in awe on my balcony as I saw the sunset over the Olympic mountains in the distance. And that's just the view of my apartment. Anywhere you go in Seattle there is some mountain

Within my first year, I was starting to do day hikes every weekend. A friend was training for Rainier, and it seemed like the perfect excuse to get out of the city. And she wasn't the only one on the trails training for Rainier, we were often met with plenty of other folks carrying way too large and heavy of packs for only a day hike.

Summiting the local mountains like Rainier, Baker, St Helens, Hood, etc all seem like a right of passage for becoming a true Washingtonian. So I put down my growler and started training.

<br>

<h2> Day One: Base Camp </h2>

<p>In January I had taken a few weeks off before starting a new job. I had just gotten my last check from the previous job, that included all my vacation cashed out. I did the only sensible thing and immediately started looking at ways to spend it. I booked a mountaineering course and immediately started climbing stairs and hitting the trails <span class="italic"> (Kind of, I twisted my foot on a hooverboard mid-january and had to delay serious training until March. But we don't talk about that).</span></p>

<p> When the week of finally approached I was having all the feelings of nervousness mixed with doubts on the amount of training I did. But after reviewing the itinerary, description and training, I knew I did everything I could (and more!) to prepare for this. </p>

<br>

<p> July 4th was the big day. Instead of spending the day drinking and eating a copious amount while waiting to watch fireworks, I woke up at 4:30AM. I packed all my gear, clothes, food, and supplies for 6-days as tightly as I could into my 85 liter pack. And at 5:15AM I was set to catch my Lyft to the office for gear check. </p>

<p> For having bought all my own gear (which I'm very glad to be done with), I did pretty well with only having forgotten my locking caribeneers. Fortunately there were plenty of climbers on the trip to lend me the two I needed. After having unpacked for the check, we repacked and loaded the van for the 3 hr drive up to the Heliotrope trailhead on Mt. Baker. </p>

</figure>
<br>

<p> Within three hours we hit the snowfield and started scouting out a spot to setup camp. We shoveled and stomped out a platform, setup our tents and made our first meals. </p>

<h2> Day Two: Knots and Snow School </h2>

<p> The first night I got just as much sleep as you'd expect. If you expected basically none, then you are correct. Fortunately day two was relatively laid back with learning about knots, rope handing and practicing moving in up a steep snowfield as a rope team.</p>

  <figcaption> Day two started out physically less demanding, with learning the essential knots and rope handling to be part of a mountaineering rope team.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br><br>


<p> Cliff notes: There are lots of useful knots. The alpine butterfly should actually be called an octopus knot, because it looks way more like a drunken octopus than a butterfly. Lead ropes are heavy, but like could totally save your life, so I guess they're worth it. Prussicks are the most simple, cheap part of alpine climbing, but yet insanely useful. Don't be a jerk who's pulling on the rope. Turns out, rock climbers have a huge advantage with this part of alpine climbing, who'd of thunk. Lastly, Imma going to be practicing these a lot more.</p>

<p> After knot tying, rope handling and stomping around a bit in the snow, we practiced arresting. This is the most basic and essential part of mountaineering that even people who do guided climbs are taught. Basically, the whole point of a rope team is to catch and rescue someone if they fall. That fall could be down a steep, slippery part of the mountain or it could be a crevasse. Either way, falling sucks. Don't do it. But like, know what to do if it happens.</p>

  <figcaption>Snow school entailed learning how to tromp around in snow, as a team, wearing crampons, and not falling. But(!), in the event of falling we also learned how to self arrest with the ice axes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p> Arresting is really the simple most thing you have to do to stop the fall. </p>

<p> While there was a lot of content this day, it was all building up to crevasse rescues, which we covered on day four. </p>
