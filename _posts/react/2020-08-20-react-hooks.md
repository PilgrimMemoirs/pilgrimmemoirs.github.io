<p><em>
This part three of a series touching on the essential parts of React.js to known when getting started. This will cover making components, handling data, working with component's state lifecycle, and using modern best practices to do so. Comfort with using terminal, Git, Github, HTML and JavaScript are recommended. Start with the <a href="{{page.previous.url}}" alt="first part of series, getting started with components" target="_blank">first part</a> of the series. If you get stuck, use this <a alt="Tutorial's github repository" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PilgrimMemoirs/essential-react-tutorial" target="_blank">repository</a>, the branch titled 'hooks' will have the final solution for this part of the series.
<br><br>
In the last post you should have set up the three components to pass and render data from a JSON file. This post is going to focus on handling a component's state with hooks.
