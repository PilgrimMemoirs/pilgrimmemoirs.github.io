        <title>Graduating my Web Design Students</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; When I saw that I was teaching a web design course I was stoked! I thought for sure that it would be a breeze since design and front end development come easy to me, but teaching something that came more intuitively proved to be more challenging than I thought.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing More Than &#39;Making Things Pretty&#39; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; During these two weeks my students went from zero to learning html, css, jquery and design theories. The last four of those days spent implementing what they learned into a final project. Craziness! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; Supermodel and former Flatiron School student, Karli Kloss, made an appearance in our classroom. Several locations around the U.S. had the opportunity to ask her questions about her experience developing, her &#39;day job&#39; and being besties with Taylor Swift.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; We now live in a world where parents pay for their kids to sit in front of a computer all day. Only now, they&#39;re making their own special mark on the internet.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure

        <title>Graduating my First Cohort of Students</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I taught my first class this past June in front of 13 teenagers who had no idea what they were getting themselves into. Much like them, I had no idea what I was getting myself into by teaching. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Learn. Love. Code. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the matter of two weeks I was meant to turn these kids from knowing nil about programing into making a live, deployed sinatra app for all the interwebs to see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Having never formally taught teenagers, I was nervous on how quickly they&#39;d pick up the material or if they&#39;d even be interested in any of it. With the help of my co-teacher, we quickly built a class that was excited to come to class and learn programming!   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; Off screen activities for the creative students include making posters to deck the classroom out in.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Welcome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; The internet would not be where it is today if it wasn&#39;t for the powers of code and cats. It was only a matter of time before a blog was created to join thier forces and explain the mysteries of each.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Cats and thier code &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hi and welcome! I&#39;m Jamie, the human behind the blog. I&#39;m starting this site as a way to not only help others get into web development, but to also help clarify the all the new web stuff I learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently started teaching in front of a class and am finding myself learning a tremendous amount while I jot my notes and lesson plan for the next day. I figured I would take what I have been working on to the next level and churn them out into posts to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog will for sure evolve over time, but I aim to cover at least basic to intermediate web development topics, coder culture and my experiences going through a bootcamp and now teaching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I also really like cats. &lt;/p&gt;
