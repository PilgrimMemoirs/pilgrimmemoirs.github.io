        <title>Graduating my Web Design Students</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two weeks ago I taught my first class in front of 13 teenagers who had no idea what they were getting themselves into. Much like them, I had no idea what I was getting myself into by teaching them, but I knew it was the start of someting great. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Learn. Love. Code. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the matter of two weeks I was meant to turn these kids from knowing nil about programing into making a live, deployed sinatra app for all the interwebz to see.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graduating my First Cohort of Students</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I taught my first class this past June in front of 13 teenagers who had no idea what they were getting themselves into. Much like them, I had no idea what I was getting myself into by teaching them, but I knew it was the start of someting great. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Learn. Love. Code. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the matter of two weeks I was meant to turn these kids from knowing nil about programing into making a live, deployed sinatra app for all the interwebz to see.  &lt;/p&gt;
