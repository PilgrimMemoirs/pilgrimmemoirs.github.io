        <title>Alpine Climbing: The First Summit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; For six precious summer days, I camped on Mt Baker for a mountaineering course that ended with a very successful summit. After living in Washington state for 2 years and doing the more strenuous day hikes, this summer seemed like the perfect time to start learning more technical skills in order to do more difficult approaches. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/mtbaker-group.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The group paying attention to an exercise with the summit of Baker in the background&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Mountains Are Calling &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first moved to Seattle, I had no idea the city was surrounded by some of the best mountains and mountain ranges. I was first surprised with my first night in my new apartment in downtown, where I stood in awe on my balcony as I saw the sunset over the Olympic mountains in the distance. And that’s just the view of my apartment. Anywhere you go in Seattle there is some mountain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within my first year, I was starting to do day hikes every weekend. A friend was training for Rainier, and it seemed like the perfect excuse to get out of the city. And she wasn’t the only one on the trails training for Rainier, we were often met with plenty of other folks carrying way too large and heavy of packs for only a day hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summiting the local mountains like Rainier, Baker, St Helens, Hood, etc all seem like a right of passage for becoming a true Washingtonian. So I put down my growler and started training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Day One: Base Camp &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January I had taken a few weeks off before starting a new job. I had just gotten my last check from the previous job, that included all my vacation cashed out. I did the only sensible thing and immediately started looking at ways to spend it. I booked a mountaineering course and immediately started climbing stairs and hitting the trails &lt;span class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt; (Kind of, I twisted my foot on a hooverboard mid-january and had to delay serious training until March. But we don't talk about that).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; When the week of finally approached I was having all the feelings of nervousness mixed with doubts on the amount of training I did. But after reviewing the itinerary, description and training, I knew I did everything I could (and more!) to prepare for this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day1-snowfield.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stepping onto the first snowfield while hiking up to base camp on Mt Baker&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day1-guides.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A scenic view with the two guides about to setup camp&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Day one revolved around getting our gear ready, driving from Seattle to Mt Baker's Heliotrope Trailhead, and hiking up to basecamp. Here we are getting on to the first snowfield and scoping out where to setup our tents.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; July 4th was the big day. Instead of spending the day drinking and eating a copious amount while waiting to watch fireworks, I woke up at 4:30AM. I packed all my gear, clothes, food, and supplies for 6-days as tightly as I could into my 85 liter pack. And at 5:15AM I was set to catch my Lyft to the office for gear check. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; For having bought all my own gear (which I'm very glad to be done with), I did pretty well with only having forgotten my locking caribeneers. Fortunately there were plenty of climbers on the trip to lend me the two I needed. After having unpacked for the check, we repacked and loaded the van for the 3 hr drive up to the Heliotrope trailhead on Mt. Baker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/mtbaker-tent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/mtbaker-meals.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Group work&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; At the first snowfield, we evened out platforms in the snow and setup our &quot;spacious&quot; 2-person (you read that right) tents. Then we used the freshly melted glacial water to make all our meals. Because we fancy. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Within three hours we hit the snowfield and started scouting out a spot to setup camp. We shoveled and stomped out a platform, setup our tents and made our first meals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Day Two: Knots and Snow School &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The first night I got just as much sleep as you'd expect. If you expected basically none, then you are correct. Fortunately day two was relatively laid back with learning about knots, rope handing and practicing moving in up a steep snowfield as a rope team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day2-knots.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day2-ropes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Group work&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Day two started out physically less demanding, with learning the essential knots and rope handling to be part of a mountaineering rope team.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cliff notes: There are lots of useful knots. The alpine butterfly should actually be called an octopus knot, because it looks way more like a drunken octopus than a butterfly. Lead ropes are heavy, but like could totally save your life, so I guess they're worth it. Prussicks are the most simple, cheap part of alpine climbing, but yet insanely useful. Don't be a jerk who's pulling on the rope. Turns out, rock climbers have a huge advantage with this part of alpine climbing, who'd of thunk. Lastly, Imma going to be practicing these a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; After knot tying, rope handling and stomping around a bit in the snow, we practiced arresting. This is the most basic and essential part of mountaineering that even people who do guided climbs are taught. Basically, the whole point of a rope team is to catch and rescue someone if they fall. That fall could be down a steep, slippery part of the mountain or it could be a crevasse. Either way, falling sucks. Don't do it. But like, know what to do if it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day2-selfarrest2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day2-selfarrest.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Group work&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Snow school entailed learning how to tromp around in snow, as a team, wearing crampons, and not falling. But(!), in the event of falling we also learned how to self arrest with the ice axes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Arresting is really the simple most thing you have to do to stop the fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While there was a lot of content this day, it was all building up to crevasse rescues, which we covered on day four. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Day Three: Ice Climbing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Paragraph  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Day Four: Crevasse Rescue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Paragraph  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; An information heavy day, where the first bit was watching and trying to absorb as much of it as possible. The second half putting it all together during simulated crevasse falls.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;My turn in the crevasse. Not too far from camp we found some safe, baby crevasses to hang out in while our trusted team 'saved' us.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day4-rappel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The day wasn't done after falling into crevasses. We wrapped up day four with learning simple ways of rappelling and ascending on a rope.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Day Five: Summit Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Paragraph  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day5-summitmorning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day5-summitstart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Summit Day! We started the day short before sunrise, which is relatively late for a summit bid on other mountains, but totes cool for Baker. I already like this mountain. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day5-summitclimb2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Summit day was a total of 9 hrs on our feet, with 6 of those going up. Typically there were 10 minute breaks in between each 1-2 hrs of climbing. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/first-summit/day5-summitgroup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; The gang made it! There's nothing like summiting to see the dozens of other mountains you plan on climbing. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>Fourth Flatiron Class: Advanced SE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; After eight weeks of teaching and getting to know some incredible kids, I have ended my summer teaching fellowship with Flatiron School with my final class, Advanced Software Engineering. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Getting Advanced &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; These seasoned Flatiron students came back for more, kicking up what they learned in SE 1 by putting databases and user sessions into their Sinatra apps. This class had a healthy mix of students from three different intro classes, two even coming from a class at the Flatiron HQ in New York.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_4/DSC_0073.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flatiron Precollege Program Advanced Class&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_4/DSC_0088.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Group work&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; The advanced class revolved heavily around group projects.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Upping the Game &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ninja. The Table Tennis. The Stickers. The Code. &lt;br /&gt;
All the above and then some were taken to a whole new level with this class. Lets just say, it got vicious. Not gonna lie, databases make you live dangerously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Sometimes, it got so dangerous, breaks to watch old reruns of Supermarket Sweep became necessary. Candied hams and  mother and daughters special for the win.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_4/DSC_0082.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Demo of student's business site&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_4/DSC_0107.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Final Ping Pong Tournament&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; One 17 year old student was showing off the website of their business &amp;amp; Daily lunch time ping pong matches.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Hanging with the Big Devs &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On our final day I was fortunate enough to arrange a class field trip down to Braintree's Chicago HQ.  One of the many perks of holding class in the Merchandise Mart is being surrounded by all sorts of legit tech companies, another one may be having Doughnut Vault across the street. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our tour of the Braintree’s HQ, we were teased with sights of all the free food, hanging out in their treehouse, devs working in giant bean bags and, best yet, their game room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, our tour guide (who’s normal day job is working as a tech recruiter) came out and surprised us all with swag on swag. We’re talking stickers, pens, notebooks and t-shirts. Ryan hooked us up!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; A last day treat of getting to tour the Braintree head office. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; The Final Finals &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the final days were spent in utter chaos, planning, learning new technologies and BUILDING AN ENTIRE APP FROM SCRATCH IN THREE DAYS! Insanity!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these kids not only pulled through, they took on major challenges and learned SO much. I couldn’t be more proud of the challenges they undertook and worked with. I don’t know if they realize how much they know  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_4/DSC_0158.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Final Project showing code&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_4/DSC_0165.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Final Project demo of app&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; The final final presentations of the summer.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Learned. Loved. Coded. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This summer, I feel like I learned just as much as these kids did. I had never been great with explaining my code or how ‘things’ worked, but this summer reaaaally stretched me to do so.  It has been an invaluable experience with instilling syntax, concepts and various technologies with myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While I was absolutely stretched outside of my comfort zone, I loved every minute of it. I can’t remember a time I worked this hard or this many hours and had no complaints. It was never easy, but knowing I was making an impact on 30+ kids lives was exceptionally rewarding.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And guess what!? I even got some time to code! Crazy!  I know Sinatra like the back of my hand and a few wacky looking codepens saved in my account, but I’ll admit, I had way too much fun making projects to demo. #Meowspace4Lyfe &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It is surreal sitting here on my couch at home, on a Monday, when I would normally be welcoming a new class. Instead, I am sending my resume and working on code challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not 100% sure what my next steps are, but I am making plans to keep teaching alongside developing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Third Flatiron Class: Intro to SE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; My second round of the Intro to Software Engineering class with my new co-teacher was yet another successful chapter in this amazing experience.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Classtime  --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It's all about the Experience &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In June I started teaching high schoolers the ins and out of web development in two week long, intensive courses. Now, they're by no means experts by the end, however, they left with a solid foundation and, more importantly, enthusiasm to continue learning! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; Forming groups and whiteboarding final project ideas  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; The Code is Incidental &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our classes, as molded by many other coding bootcamps, the culture is just as essential as the code itself. The goal is not only to get kids engaged in coding, but to also form strong relationships with thier peers. Doing so  helps so so soooooo much more for building a strong classroom culture that opens up discussion, questions and self discovering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The less dependant the students become on me and the more the rely on thier peers, the less work to do. Win win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Final Projects &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the end, we had four AMAZING final projects that were bulit in only a couple days, including ideation to the final  touches. Each group had their own twist on what they chose to focus on. Having a lot of natural designers, many latched on to displaying their content beautifly while other had very intericite logic  on thier backend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Science Fair &amp; Graduation --&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; Final projects are setup for demonstration to visiting family and guests. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Serious Developers &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Seriously, these kids knocked out AMAZING projects and absorbed so much in the two weeks we had them. It's crazy to think that we still managed to fit in improv games and just be silly with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It was sad to let yet another class go, especially one so unique and diverse in thier talents. That said, I'm incredibly proud of the work they did and how well they all joined forces to make incredible projects! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Second Flatiron Class: Intro to Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; When I saw that I was teaching a web design course I was stoked! I thought for sure that it would be a breeze since design and front end development come easy to me, but teaching something that came more intuitively proved to be more challenging than I thought.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing More Than 'Making Things Pretty' &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; During these two weeks my students went from zero to learning html, css, jquery and design theories. The last four of those days spent implementing what they learned into a final project. Pure craziness! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I was lucky enough with this class that a good chunck had already taken the previous course and were familiar with the  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_2/IMG_2154.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Q and A with Karlie Kloss&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; One day coding was interrupted by supermodel and Taylor Swift bestie, Karlie Kloss talking about her coding and bootcamp experience. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; The Final Projects &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Squeezing front end coding and design theory into a couple of weeks wasn't easy, but these kids knocked it out of the park when it came time to make their final projects. It's the most gratifying feeling when kids pickup and apply tough concepts and code after minimal instruction. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; With site that's out of this world, this team came together to make a beautiful and creative app with a whole lotta pizzaz.  &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Too many goodbyes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Not only did I have to say goodbye to the majority of students in this class, but also my incredible co-teacher Jeff. I really couldn't have asked for a better bunch to be part of my first month of teaching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>First Flatiron Class: Intro To SE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I taught my very first class this past June in front of 13 teenagers who, much like myself, had no idea what they were getting themselves into.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Learn. Love. Code. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the matter of two weeks I was meant to turn these kids from knowing nil about programing into making a live, deployed sinatra app for all the interwebs to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Having never formally taught teenagers, I was nervous on how quickly they'd pick up the material or if they'd even be interested in any of it. With the help of a fantastic co-teacher, we quickly built a class that was not only excited to come to class, but also code!   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../images/flatiron/class_1/IMG_2223.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;students graduating from flatiron precollege program inchicago&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; Students showing off their code in front of friends and family.  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Not your average classroom &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sure, kids were spending full days inside a room learning things. You'd think it'd be a lot like school, but it wasn't. And we made sure of it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Classroom culture was key and easily one of the most imporant parts of our classes. We made sure to have plenty of breaks, do improv and have a classroom that wouldn't be afraid of being silly in front of each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; Making code fun with poster making and silly sites  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Final Projects &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The first round of final projects set the bar high! Before starting I thought it was crazy making kids build an app in only a couple days. But they constantly suprised me and put these projects together like they'd been coding for years. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; The punny team that built  The Punnerator  as their final project had way too much fun! &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;





&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>Welcome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; The internet would not be where it is today if it wasn't for the powers of code and cats. It was only a matter of time before a blog was created to join their forces and explain the mysteries of each.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Cats and thier code &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hi and welcome! I'm Jamie, the human behind the blog. I'm starting this site as a way to not only help others get into web development, but to also help clarify the all the new web stuff I learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently started teaching web development courses to high schoolers this summer and am finding myself learning a tremendous amount while I jot my notes and lesson plan for the next day. I figured I would take what I have been working on to the next level and churn them out into posts to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog will for sure evolve over time, but I aim to cover at least basic to intermediate web development topics, coder culture and my experiences going through a bootcamp and now teaching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I also really like cats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
