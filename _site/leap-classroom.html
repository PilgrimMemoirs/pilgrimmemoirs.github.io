  <article class="post-content">
    <p><em>One month ago I was back home in Wisconsin, visiting family, when I got the call congratulating me on being accepted into Microsoft LEAP’s TPM track. As I’m writing this, it’s the weekend in between completing the 3 week classroom-based prep portion of the program and starting my first day on my sponsoring team.</em></p>

<h2> The First Days </h2>

<p>The first couple of days were introductions and getting setup. That’s basically it.</p>

<p>
That entailed getting our badges, laptops, a swag bag chock full of goodies, and trying to find room in the cafeteria for all of us to sit. We were very aspirational with that last one.
</p>

<p>
In general, these days didn’t have much content-wise, but it was very reflective of a typical first day starting with any program or job of this sort. Everyone comes in full of energy, only to spend it mostly on waiting to get permission before actually being able to do anything.
</p>

  <figcaption>On day two we were fitted out with some swag (a backpack, mousepad with wireless charger, a battery pack and a retractable badge clip). We also got a Surface laptop to use during the apprenticeship.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2> Week 1: Mock Sprint </h2>

<p>
By Wednesday of the first week, we started our ‘educational’ portion of sitting for hours watching linkedin learning videos. Content-wise, they were good. But having significant amounts of classroom time spent sitting and watching videos? It really could have been better used.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the hours spent watching videos, were several hours designated towards running through a mock sprint with our assigned teams. This gave us the opportunity to get familiar with Azure Devops and the general process of planning sprint work, defining tasks, and then prioritizing them. Of the work time, this was definitely the most useful.
</p>

<h2> Week 2: Console Wheel of Fortune Project </h2>

<p>
Building on top of the mock sprint, we refined our agile workflow by building a Wheel of Fortune console app. This, hands-down, was the most beneficial week. A reasonable amount of people in the cohort haven’t had experience with being so involved in the agile process.
</p>

<p>
This week was a nice, condensed way of experiencing a sprint from start to finish. The goal was to define what features would be feasible to have a working MVP (minimum viable product) by the end of the week.
</p>

<p>
There was also a mix of even more video courses we took. Again, not a great use of time. But the topics of the courses were worth doing, including the soft skills ones.
</p>

  <figcaption>The team only had (maybe) a couple of designated hours to actually code the final project. Time got time, and the stressed kicked in during those final days.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2> Week 3: Final Project </h2>

<p>
This week was a mess. It was pretty poorly planned where we ended up only having several hours to complete an entire project, with more requirements than the week before. And there were some activities that really could have been left out.
</p>

<p>
Every other person I’ve talked to from my cohort had pretty strong feelings about how this week could have been different. We will just leave it at that. The week ended with presenting our projects to the class.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately there were some phenomenal sessions we had with FTE’s (full time employees, how Microsoft refers to their hired/non-contracting employees). They gave a tremendous amount of insight into what we could actually expect when we joined our teams.
</p>

<h2> That's a wrap </h2>

<p>
While I, along with my peers, had different expectations for what we thought this classroom portion was going to be like, it was beneficial just to get acquainted with being on campus and bonding with each other. Already we are benefiting from having each others support, and that’s something you never get when you get hired into a company alone.
