<h2><strong> Jamie </strong></h2>
<h4> The human behind the code.</h4>
<p>
  A farm raised, free-range designer & developer. A year ago I decided I wanted to do more with other than make things look really, really ridiculously good looking.
</p>

<p>
     Summer of 2014 was transformative as I first started learning web development through a <a href="http://gdichicago.com/" target="_blank"> Girl Develop It</a> class that led me to attend and graduate from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp </a> by January 2015.</p>

<p> 
  I freelanced as a web designer and developer until accepting a summer teaching position for a precollege program through The Flatiron School. Writing extensive notes for my lesson plans inspired the creation of this blog.

<h2><strong> Octo & Amper </strong></h2>
<h4>The Cats Behind the Code </h4>
<img src="../images/cats/welcome/3.JPG">
<p> Octo (short for Octothorpe, black) & Amper (Ampersand, tabby) were adopted from PAWS chicago a month after I finished Dev Bootcamp. These little fur balls have kept me company through long hours of freelance coding at home. They've also better at making bugs than catching them. </p>
