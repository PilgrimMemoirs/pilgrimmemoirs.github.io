<h4> The human behind the code.</h4>
<p>
  A farm raised, free-range designer & developer. A year ago I decided I wanted to do more with other than make things look really, really ridiculously good looking.
</p>

<p>
     Summer of 2014 was transformative as I first started learning web development going on to graduate from Dev Bootcamp by January 2015. I adopted Amper and Octo in February I freelanced until accepting a summer teaching inspiration that inpsired me to start this blog.

<h4>The Cats Behind the Code </h4>
<img src="../images/cats/welcome/3.JPG">
<p> Octo (short for Octothorpe, black) & Amper (Ampersand, tabby) were adopted from PAWS chicago a month after I finished Dev Bootcamp. These little fur balls have kept me company through long hours of freelance coding at home. They've also better at making bugs than catching them. </p>

<p>
  I'm a huge advocate for adopting animals from shelters and have been impressed with everything that PAWS chicago stands for. <a href="http://pawschicago.com"> Check 'em out!</a>
