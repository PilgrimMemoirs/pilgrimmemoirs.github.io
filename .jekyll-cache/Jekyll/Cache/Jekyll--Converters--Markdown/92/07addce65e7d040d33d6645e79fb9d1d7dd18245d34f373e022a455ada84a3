In order to hold myself accountable, I'm using daily blogs to track what I learned that day, no matter how small or basic it might be.</em></p>

<h2>Udemy: The Coding Interview boot camp: Algorithms + Data Structures</h2>
<p>Went back to the recursive solution for the fibonacci problem, marveled at it's time complexity and introduced memoization.</p>
<p>Implemented a queue in JavaScript, utilizing an array. Solved a problem weaving two queues together.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Leetcode: Practice &amp; Explore</h2>
<p>I checked out their explore/learn part of the site, starting with Queues. I like having both video and reading resources, and I like that this one has a nice structure for written material, with animations. I think it's going to pair well with the udemy course I'm watching.</p>
<p>Did and quick'n'dirty (read: easy) problem with fining the length of the last word in a string. Knocked it out. On to the next! (read: medium &amp; hard problems)</p>
