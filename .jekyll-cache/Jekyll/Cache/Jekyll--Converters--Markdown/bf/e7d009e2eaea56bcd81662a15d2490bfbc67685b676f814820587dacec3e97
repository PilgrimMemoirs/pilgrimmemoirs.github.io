I"}<p><em>This is the first post in a series I'm doing touching on essential parts of React.js you should know when getting started. Components will be function-based, using React Hooks, to cover how to handle props and state, component lifecycle and where to use ES6 features. Follow along with this GitHub repository, where each phase of the tutorial has it's own branch. </em></p>
