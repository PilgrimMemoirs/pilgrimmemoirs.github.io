I"¤<p><em>This is the first post in a series touching on essential parts of React.js you should know when getting started. Components will be function-based, using React Hooks, to cover how to handle props and state, component lifecycle and where to use ES6 features. Follow along with this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PilgrimMemoirs/essential-react-tutorial), where each phase of the tutorial has it's own branch. </em></p>

<h2> The Project </h2>
<p>We will be building the front-end for an app that lets users to view information about parks, and the trails inside each park. Users can also leave reviews for parks and trails.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Components</h3>
<p>If you're familiar with JavaScript, then functional components should feel fairly natural. </p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Park</span><span class="p">({}){</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3>A Note on Functional vs Class Components</h3>
<p>This project is going to strictly use functional components, but prior to something called React Hooks was released in 2019</p>
