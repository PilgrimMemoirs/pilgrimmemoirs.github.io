<h2>Doing More Than 'Making Things Pretty' </h2>

<p> During these two weeks my students went from zero to learning html, css, jquery and design theories. The last four of those days spent implementing what they learned into a final project. Pure craziness! </p>

<h2> The Final Projects </h2>
<p> Squeezing front end coding and design theory into a couple of weeks wasn't easy, but these kids knocked it out of the park when it came time to make their final projects. It's the most gratifying feeling when kids pickup and apply tough concepts and code after minimal instruction. </p>

<h2> Too many goodbyes </h2>
<p> Not only did I have to say goodbye to the majority of students in this class, but also my incredible co-teacher Jeff. I really couldn't have asked for a better bunch to be part of my first month of teaching. </p>
