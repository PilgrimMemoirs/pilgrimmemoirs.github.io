<h2>Udemy: The Coding Interview boot camp: <br /> Algorithms + Data Structures</h2>
<p>Solidified <b>stacks and queues</b> knowledge by solving the <b>'queue from stacks'</b> problem. The problem has you building a queue class that has all the functionality of a queue, but is built on two stacks. It's wacky. It's the most impractical thing ever. But it's yet another problem to keep you on your toes, and (allegedly) it demonstrates that you know how both queues and stacks work. </p>

<h2>Leetcode: Practice &amp; Explore</h2>
<p>I checked out their explore/learn part of the site, starting with Queues. I like having both video and reading resources, and I like that this one has a nice structure for written material, with animations. I think it's going to pair well with the udemy course I'm watching.</p>
<p>Did and quick'n'dirty (read: easy) problem with fining the length of the last word in a string. Knocked it out. On to the next! (read: medium &amp; hard problems)</p>
