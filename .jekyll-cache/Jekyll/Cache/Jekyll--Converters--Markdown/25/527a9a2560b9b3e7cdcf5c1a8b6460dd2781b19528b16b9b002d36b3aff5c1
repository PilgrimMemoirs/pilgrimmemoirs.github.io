This is the first post in a series touching on essential parts of React.js that should be known when getting started. We will cover components, handling data, component lifecycle, and using modern best practices to do so. Comfort with using terminal, Git, Github, HTML and JavaScript are recommended.

<h2> The Project </h2>
<p>
We will be building the front-end for an app that lets users view information about parks, and the trails inside each park. Users can also leave reviews for parks and trails.
</p>

<h2> Setup </h2>
<p>
Use this <a alt="Tutorial's github repository" href="https://github.com/PilgrimMemoirs/essential-react-tutorial">GitHub repository</a> to follow along or use as a reference. I recommend forking and cloning so you have your own copy.
<p>

<p>
Once you have the repository cloned onto your computer, navigate inside of the essential-react-tutorial directoy, in your terminal, and run this command:
</p>

<code>$ yarn create create-react-app .</code>
<p><em>
Note: I use Yarn as my package manager, if you use another (like npm) replace yarn with that package manager's command. Also, the '$' indicates this is a terminal command, so don't copy that character when you see it at the start of code snippet.
</em></p>
<br />

<p>
Now, start the server! Keep this running in a new terminal window. Your browser window will automatically refresh when you make changes.
</p>
<code>$ yarn start</code>

<p> </p>



<h2>Components</h2>
<p></p>


<code>$ mkdir src/components</code><br />
<code>$ touch src/components/Park.js</code><br />
<code>$ touch src/components/Trail.js</code><br />
<code>$ touch src/components/Review.js</code>

<h3>A Note on Functional vs Class Components</h3>
<p>
This project is going to strictly use functional components, but prior to something called React Hooks was released in 2019
