<h2> The Project </h2>
<p>We will be building the front-end for an app that lets users to view information about parks, and the trails inside each park. Users can also leave reviews for parks and trails.</p>

<h2> Get Started </h2>
<p> Use this ![GitHub repository](https://github.com/PilgrimMemoirs/essential-react-tutorial) to follow along or use as a reference. I recommend forking and cloning so you have your own copy.<p>

<p>Once you have the repository cloned, navigate inside of the essential-react-tutorial directoy, in your terminal, and run this command:</p>

<div class="center">
  <code>$ yarn create create-react-app .</code>
  <p><em>(Note: this assumes you use Yarn as your package manager, if you use another (like npm) replace yarn with that package manager's command.
  <br /> The '$' indicates this is a terminal command, so don't copy that character when you see it at the start of code snippet.)</em></p>
  <br />
  <code>$ yarn start</code>
</div>



<h2>Components</h2>
