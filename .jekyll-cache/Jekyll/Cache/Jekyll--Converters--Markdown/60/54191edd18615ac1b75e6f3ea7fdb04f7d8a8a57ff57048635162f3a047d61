I"†<p><em>This is the first post in a series I'm doing touching on essential parts of React you should know when getting started. Components will be function-based, using React Hooks, to cover how to handle props and state, component lifecycle and where to use ES6 features. Follow along with this GitHub repository, where each phase of the tutorial has it's own branch. </em></p>

<h2> The Project </h2>
<p>This tutorial series will be building a React app for people to find trails within certain parks. Users will be able to view details on the parks and trails, as well as being able to review them.</p>

<h2>The Project's Components</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>Components</h3>
<p>If you're familiar with JavaScript, then functional components should feel fairly natural. </p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Park</span><span class="p">({}){</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3>A Note on Functional vs Class Components</h3>
<p>This project is going to strictly use functional components, but prior to something called React Hooks was released in 2019</p>
