<h4> The human behind the code.</h4>
<p>
  A farm raised, free-range designer &amp; developer. A year ago I decided I wanted to do more with other than make things look really, really ridiculously good looking.
</p>

<p>
     Summer of 2014 was transformative as I first started learning web development through a <a href="http://gdichicago.com/" target="_blank"> Girl Develop It</a> class that led me to attend and graduate from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp </a> by January 2015.</p>

<p> 
  I freelanced as a web designer and developer until accepting a summer teaching position for a precollege program through The Flatiron School. Writing extensive notes for my lesson plans inspired the creation of this blog.

<h4>The Cats Behind the Code </h4>
<p><img src="../images/cats/welcome/3.JPG" /></p>
<p> Octo (short for Octothorpe, black) &amp; Amper (Ampersand, tabby) were adopted from PAWS chicago a month after I finished Dev Bootcamp. These little fur balls have kept me company through long hours of freelance coding at home. They've also better at making bugs than catching them. </p>

<h2><strong> The Blog </strong></h2>
<!-- <h4> The human behind the code.</h4> -->

<p> This blog is built using one of the most liberating blogging technologies; with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages with a custom domain slapped on it. </p>

<!-- <p> The best part of using Jekyll is having total creative control over how my blog looks and even functions. It also has snazz factor with using Ruby! </p>

<p> Hang tight and I will most likely post a tutorial on getting started with making your own! </p> -->
